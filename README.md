install using ```pip install -e .```

run using ```aoc <action> <year> <day>[ <suffix>]```

```
action is either init or run
suffix can be used to run alternative input files (e.g. example or big)
```

This repository only included the files I made to initialize and solve each day. Input files are not included (because redistributing puzzles or input is not allowed, and because it is very likely you will have a different input than I got).
